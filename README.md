Traditional CT reconstruction methods require hundreds of X-ray projections through a full rotational scan of the body, which cannot be performed on a typical X-ray machine. In this work, we propose to reconstruct CT from two orthogonal X-rays using the generative adversarial network (GAN) framework. A specially designed generator network is exploited to increase data dimension from 2D (X-rays) to 3D (CT), which is not addressed in previous research of GAN. A novel feature fusion method is proposed to combine information from two X-rays. The mean squared error (MSE) loss and adversarial loss are combined to train the generator, resulting in a high-quality CT volume both visually and quantitatively. Extensive experiments on a publicly available chest CT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It could be a nice enhancement of a low-cost X-ray machine to provide physicians a CT-like 3D volume in several niche applications.</details> | ❌

Sparse-view CT is an effective and feasible method to reduce the radiation dose. However, the conventional filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm will suffer from severe artifacts in sparse-view CT. Iterative reconstruction algorithms have been adopted to remove artifacts, but they are time-consuming due to repeated projection and back projection and may cause blocky effects. To overcome the difficulty in sparse-view CT, we proposed a dual-domain sparse-view CT algorithm CT Transformer (CTTR) and paid attention to sinogram information.Methods:CTTR treats sinograms as sentences and enhances reconstructed images with sinogram’s characteristics. We qualitatively evaluate the CTTR, an iterative method TVM-POCS, a convolutional neural network based method FBPConvNet in terms of a reduction in artifacts and a preservation of details. Besides, we also quantitatively evaluate these methods in terms of RMSE, PSNR and SSIM.Results:We evaluate our method on the Lung Image Database Consortium image collection with different numbers of projection views and noise levels. Experiment studies show that, compared with other methods, CTTR can reduce more artifacts and preserve more details on various scenarios. Specifically, CTTR improves the FBPConvNet performance of PSNR by 0.76 dB with 30 projections.Conclusions:The performance of our proposed CTTR is better than the method based on CNN in the case of extremely sparse views both on visual results and quantitative evaluation. Our proposed method provides a new idea for the application of Transformers to CT image processing.</details> | ❌

Iterative models are proposed to alleviate the appeared artifacts in sparse-view CT images, but their computational cost is expensive. Deep-learning-based methods have gained prevalence due to the excellent reconstruction performances and computation efficiency. However, these methods ignore the mismatch between the CNN’s local feature extraction capability and the sinogram’s global characteristics. To overcome the problem, we propose Dual-Domain Transformer (DuDoTrans) to simultaneously restore informative sinograms via the long-range dependency modeling capability of Transformer and reconstruct CT image with both the enhanced and raw sinograms. With such a novel design, DuDoTrans even with fewer involved parameters is more effective and generalizes better than competing methods, which is confirmed by reconstruction performances on the NIH-AAPM and COVID-19 datasets. Finally, experiments also demonstrate its robustness to noise.</details> |  ❌

Recently, some works have attempted to use diffusion models to address the over-smoothness and training instability encountered by previous deep-learning-based denoising models. However, diffusion models suffer from long inference time due to a large number of sampling steps involved. Very recently, cold diffusion model generalizes classical diffusion models and has greater flexibility. Inspired by cold diffusion, this paper presents a novel COntextual eRror-modulated gEneralized Diffusion model for low-dose CT (LDCT) denoising, termed CoreDiff. First, CoreDiff utilizes LDCT images to displace the random Gaussian noise and employs a novel mean-preserving degradation operator to mimic the physical process of CT degradation, significantly reducing sampling steps thanks to the informative LDCT images as the starting point of the sampling process. Second, to alleviate the error accumulation problem caused by the imperfect restoration operator in the sampling process, we propose a novel ContextuaL Error-modulAted Restoration Network (CLEAR-Net), which can leverage contextual information to constrain the sampling process from structural distortion and modulate time step embedding features for better alignment with the input at the next time step. Third, to rapidly generalize the trained model to a new, unseen dose level with as few resources as possible, we devise a one-shot learning framework to make CoreDiff generalize faster and better using only one single LDCT image (un)paired with normal-dose CT (NDCT). Extensive experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that our CoreDiff outperforms competing methods in denoising and generalization performance, with clinically acceptable inference time.

However, hardware limitations and time constraints often result in the acquisition of anisotropic MR images. It is highly desirable but very challenging to enhance image spatial resolution in medical image analysis for disease diagnosis. Recently, studies have shown that deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) can significantly boost the performance of MR image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction. In this paper, we present a novel CNN-based anisotropic MR image reconstruction method based on residual learning with long and short skip connections. The proposed network can effectively alleviate the vanishing gradient problem of deep networks and learn to restore high-frequency details of MR images. To reduce computational complexity and memory usage, the proposed network utilizes cross-plane self-similarity of 3D T1-weighted (T1w) MR images. Based on experiments on simulated and clinical brain MR images, we demonstrate that the proposed network can significantly improve the spatial resolution of anisotropic MR images with high computational efficiency. The network trained on T1w MR images is able to effectively reconstruct both SR T1w and T2-weighted (T2w) images, exploiting image features for multi-modality reconstruction. Moreover, the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms classical interpolation methods, non-local means method (NLM), and sparse coding based algorithm in terms of peak signal-to-noise-ratio, structural similarity image index, intensity profile, and small structures. The proposed method can be efficiently applied to SR reconstruction of thick-slice MR images in the out-of-plane views for radiological assessment and post-acquisition processing.</details> |  ❌
| 8   | [SLATER](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08059) | Unsupervised MRI Reconstruction via Zero-Shot Learned Adversarial Transformers | TMI(2022) | MRI| Slice|Introduce an unsupervised MRI reconstruction method using adversarial transformers to learn MRI priors and perform zero-shot inference for improved image quality.  | <details><summary>Click</summary> Supervised reconstruction models are characteristically trained on matched pairs of undersampled and fully-sampled data to capture an MRI prior, along with supervision regarding the imaging operator to enforce data consistency. To reduce supervision requirements, the recent deep image prior framework instead conjoins untrained MRI priors with the imaging operator during inference. Yet, canonical convolutional architectures are suboptimal in capturing long-range relationships, and priors based on randomly initialized networks may yield suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, here we introduce a novel unsupervised MRI reconstruction method based on zero-Shot Learned Adversarial TransformERs (SLATER). SLATER embodies a deep adversarial network with cross-attention transformers to map noise and latent variables onto coil-combined MR images. During pre-training, this unconditional network learns a high-quality MRI prior in an unsupervised generative modeling task. During inference, a zero-shot reconstruction is then performed by incorporating the imaging operator and optimizing the prior to maximize consistency to undersampled data. Comprehensive experiments on brain MRI datasets clearly demonstrate the superior performance of SLATER against state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. </details> | [🔗](https://github.com/icon-lab/SLATER)

However, its lengthy image reconstruction time may hinder its clinical translation. The purpose of this study was to develop a neural network for reconstruction of non-Cartesian real-time cine MRI k-space data faster (<1 min per slice with 80 frames) than graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated CS reconstruction, without significant loss in image quality or accuracy in left ventricular (LV) functional parameters. We introduce a perceptual complex neural network (PCNN) that trains on complex-valued MRI signal and incorporates a perceptual loss term to suppress incoherent image details. This PCNN was trained and tested with multi-slice, multi-phase, cine images from 40 patients (20 for training, 20 for testing), where the zero-filled images were used as input and the corresponding CS reconstructed images were used as practical ground truth. The resulting images were compared using quantitative metrics (structural similarity index (SSIM) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE)) and visual scores (conspicuity, temporal fidelity, artifacts, and noise scores), individually graded on a five-point scale (1, worst; 3, acceptable; 5, best), and LV ejection fraction (LVEF). The mean processing time per slice with 80 frames for PCNN was 23.7 ± 1.9 s for pre-processing (Step 1, same as CS) and 0.822 ± 0.004 s for dealiasing (Step 2, 166 times faster than CS). Our PCNN produced higher data fidelity metrics (SSIM = 0.88 ± 0.02, NRMSE = 0.014 ± 0.004) compared with CS. While all the visual scores were significantly different (P < 0.05), the median scores were all 4.0 or higher for both CS and PCNN. LVEFs measured from CS and PCNN were strongly correlated (R2 = 0.92) and in good agreement (mean difference = −1.4% [2.3% of mean]; limit of agreement = 10.6% [17.6% of mean]). The proposed PCNN is capable of rapid reconstruction (25 s per slice with 80 frames) of non-Cartesian real-time cine MRI k-space data, without significant loss in image quality or accuracy in LV functional parameters.</details> | ❌

Instantaneous volumetric imaging could provide precise knowledge of tumour and normal organs’ three-dimensional (3D) movement, which is the key to reducing the negative effect of breathing motion. Therefore, this study proposed a real-time 3D MRI reconstruction method from cine-MRI using an unsupervised network.Methods and materials Cine-MRI and setup 3D-MRI from eight patients with liver cancer were utilized to establish and validate the deep learning network for 3D-MRI reconstruction. Unlike previous methods that required 4D-MRI for network training, the proposed method utilized a reference 3D-MRI and cine-MRI to generate the training data. Then, a network was trained in an unsupervised manner to estimate the relationship between the cine-MRI acquired on coronal plane and deformation vector field (DVF) that describes the patient's breathing motion. After the training process, the coronal cine-MRI were inputted into the network, and the corresponding DVF was obtained. By wrapping the reference 3D-MRI with the generated DVF, the 3D-MRI could be reconstructed.Results The reconstructed 3D-MRI slices were compared with the corresponding phase-sorted cine-MRI using dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of liver contours and blood vessel localization error. In all patients, the liver DSC had mean value >96.1% and standard deviation < 1.3%; the blood vessel localization error had mean value <2.6 mm, and standard deviation was <2.0 mm. Moreover, the time for 3D-MRI reconstruction was approximately 100 ms. These results indicated that the proposed method could accurately reconstruct the 3D-MRI in real time.Conclusions The proposed method could accurately reconstruct the 3D-MRI from cine-MRI in real time. This method has great potential in improving the accuracy of radiotherapy for moving tumours.</details> | ❌

Therefore, there is great interest in reconstructing SPET images from LPET images. However, prior studies focus solely on image data, neglecting vital complementary information from other modalities, e.g., patients’ clinical tabular, resulting in compromised reconstruction with limited diagnostic utility. Moreover, they often overlook the semantic consistency between real SPET and reconstructed images, leading to distorted semantic contexts. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Multi-modal Conditioned Adversarial Diffusion model (MCAD) to reconstruct SPET images from multi-modal inputs, including LPET images and clinical tabular. Specifically, our MCAD incorporates a Multi-modal conditional Encoder (Mc-Encoder) to extract multi-modal features, followed by a conditional diffusion process to blend noise with multi-modal features and gradually map blended features to the target SPET images. To balance multi-modal inputs, the Mc-Encoder embeds Optimal Multi-modal Transport co-Attention (OMTA) to narrow the heterogeneity gap between image and tabular while capturing their interactions, providing sufficient guidance for reconstruction. In addition, to mitigate semantic distortions, we introduce the Multi-Modal Masked Text Reconstruction (M3TRec), which leverages semantic knowledge extracted from denoised PET images to restore the masked clinical tabular, thereby compelling the network to maintain accurate semantics during reconstruction. To expedite the diffusion process, we further introduce an adversarial diffusive network with a reduced number of diffusion steps. Experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.</details> | ❌

Generally, standard-dose PET (SPET) images contain more diagnostic information than low-dose PET (LPET) images but higher-dose scans can also bring higher potential radiation risks. To reduce the radiation risk while acquiring high-quality PET images, in this paper, we propose a 3D multi-modality edge-aware Transformer-GAN for high-quality SPET reconstruction using the corresponding LPET images and T1 acquisitions from magnetic resonance imaging (T1-MRI). Specifically, to fully excavate the metabolic distributions in LPET and anatomical structural information in T1-MRI, we first use two separate CNN-based encoders to extract local spatial features from the two modalities, respectively, and design a multimodal feature integration module to effectively integrate the two kinds of features given the diverse contributions of features at different locations. Then, as CNNs can describe local spatial information well but have difficulty in modeling long-range dependencies in images, we further apply a Transformer-based encoder to extract global semantic information in the input images and use a CNN decoder to transform the encoded features into SPET images. Finally, a patch-based discriminator is applied to ensure the similarity of patch-wise data distribution between the reconstructed and real images. Considering the importance of edge information in anatomical structures for clinical disease diagnosis, besides voxel-level estimation error and adversarial loss, we also introduce an edge-aware loss to retain more edge detail information in the reconstructed SPET images. Experiments on the phantom dataset and clinical dataset validate that our proposed method can effectively reconstruct high-quality SPET images and outperform current state-of-the-art methods in terms of qualitative and quantitative metrics.</details> | ❌

To address these challenges, we propose several PET-specific adaptations of score-based generative models. The proposed framework is developed for both 2D and 3D PET. In addition, we provide an extension to guided reconstruction using magnetic resonance images. We validate the approach through extensive 2D and 3D in-silico experiments with a model trained on patient-realistic data without lesions, and evaluate on data without lesions as well as out-of-distribution data with lesions.

The emerging Mamba has shown superiority in learning visual representation, which combines the advantages of linear scalability and global sensitivity. In this study, we introduce MambaMIR, an Arbitrary-Masked Mamba-based model with wavelet decomposition for joint medical image reconstruction and uncertainty estimation. A novel Arbitrary Scan Masking (ASM) mechanism “masks out” redundant information to introduce randomness for further uncertainty estimation. Compared to the commonly used Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, our proposed MC-ASM provides an uncertainty map without the need for hyperparameter tuning and mitigates the performance drop typically observed when applying dropout to low-level tasks. For further texture preservation and better perceptual quality, we employ the wavelet transformation into MambaMIR and explore its variant based on the Generative Adversarial Network, namely MambaMIR-GAN. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted for multiple representative medical image reconstruction tasks, demonstrating that the proposed MambaMIR and MambaMIR-GAN outperform other baseline and state-of-the-art methods in different reconstruction tasks, where MambaMIR achieves the best reconstruction fidelity and MambaMIR-GAN has the best perceptual quality.

The recent advent of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model in the natural language processing field has attracted much attention due to its ability to process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D medical images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range. These adaptations make the proposed Restore-RWKV an efficient and effective model for medical image restoration. Even a lightweight variant of Restore-RWKV, with only 1.16 million parameters, achieves comparable or even superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the resulting Restore-RWKV achieves SOTA performance across a range of medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, MRI image super-resolution, and all-in-one medical image restoration.

In this article, we propose a Deep Efficient End-to-end Reconstruction (DEER) network for few-view breast CT image reconstruction. The major merits of our network include high dose efficiency, excellent image quality, and low model complexity. By the design, the proposed network can learn the reconstruction process with as few as (9(N) parameters, where N is the side length of an image to be reconstructed, which represents orders of magnitude improvements relative to the state-of-the-art deeplearning-based reconstruction methods that map raw data to tomographic images directly. Also, validated on a cone-beam breast CT dataset prepared by Koning Corporation on a commercial scanner, our method demonstrates a competitive performance over the state-of-the-art reconstruction networks in terms of image quality.

However, decreasing the projection number to lower the X-ray radiation dose usually leads to severe streak artifacts. To improve the quality of the images reconstructed from sparse-view projection data, we developed a hybrid-domain neural network (HDNet) processing for sparse-view CT (SVCT) reconstruction in this study. The HDNet decomposes the SVCT reconstruction problem into two stages and each stage focuses on one mission, which reduces the learning difficulty of the entire network. Experiments based on the simulated and clinical datasets are performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Compared with other competitive algorithms, quantitative and qualitative results show that the proposed method makes a great improvement on artifact suppression, tiny structure restoration, and contrast retention.</details> |  ❌

The objective of this study was to compare image quality and clinically significant lesion detection on deep learning reconstruction (DLR) and iterative reconstruction (IR) images of submillisievert chest and abdominopelvic CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Our prospective multiinstitutional study included 59 adult patients (33 women, 26 men; mean age ± SD, 65 ± 12 years old; mean body mass index [weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters] = 27 ± 5) who underwent routine chest (n = 22; 16 women, six men) and abdominopelvic (n = 37; 17 women, 20 men) CT on a 640-MDCT scanner (Aquilion ONE, Canon Medical Systems). All patients gave written informed consent for the acquisition of low-dose (LD) CT (LDCT) after a clinically indicated standard-dose (SD) CT (SDCT). The SDCT series (120 kVp, 164–644 mA) were reconstructed with interactive reconstruction (IR) (adaptive iterative dose reduction [AIDR] 3D, Canon Medical Systems), and the LDCT (100 kVp, 120 kVp; 30–50 mA) were reconstructed with filtered back-projection (FBP), IR (AIDR 3D and forward-projected model-based iterative reconstruction solution [FIRST], Canon Medical Systems), and deep learning reconstruction (DLR) (Advanced Intelligent Clear-IQ Engine [AiCE], Canon Medical Systems). Four subspecialty-trained radiologists first read all LD image sets and then compared them side-by-side with SD AIDR 3D images in an independent, randomized, and blinded fashion. Subspecialty radiologists assessed image quality of LDCT images on a 3-point scale (1 = unacceptable, 2 = suboptimal, 3 = optimal). Descriptive statistics were obtained, and the Wilcoxon sign rank test was performed. RESULTS. Mean volume CT dose index and dose-length product for LDCT (2.1 ± 0.8 mGy, 49 ± 13mGy·cm) were lower than those for SDCT (13 ± 4.4 mGy, 567 ± 249 mGy·cm) (p < 0.0001). All 31 clinically significant abdominal lesions were seen on SD AIDR 3D and LD DLR images. Twenty-five, 18, and seven lesions were detected on LD AIDR 3D, LD FIRST, and LD FBP images, respectively. All 39 pulmonary nodules detected on SD AIDR 3D images were also noted on LD DLR images. LD DLR images were deemed acceptable for interpretation in 97% (35/37) of abdominal and 95–100% (21–22/22) of chest LDCT studies (p = 0.2–0.99). The LD FIRST, LD AIDR 3D, and LD FBP images had inferior image quality compared with SD AIDR 3D images (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION. At submillisievert chest and abdominopelvic CT doses, DLR enables image quality and lesion detection superior to commercial IR and FBP images.</details> |  ❌

How the DLR affects image quality and radiation dose reduction has yet to be fully investigated. Purpose To investigate a DLR algorithm’s dose reduction and image quality improvement for pediatric CT. Materials and Methods DLR was compared with filtered back projection (FBP), statistical-based iterative reconstruction (SBIR), and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) in a retrospective study by using data from CT examinations of pediatric patients (February to December 2018). A comparison of object detectability for 15 objects (diameter, 0.5–10 mm) at four contrast difference levels (50, 150, 250, and 350 HU) was performed by using a non-prewhitening-matched mathematical observer model with eye filter (d’NPWE), task transfer function, and noise power spectrum analysis. Object detectability was assessed by using area under the curve analysis. Three pediatric radiologists performed an observer study to assess anatomic structures with low object-to-background signal and contrast to noise in the azygos vein, right hepatic vein, common bile duct, and superior mesenteric artery. Observers rated from 1 to 10 (worst to best) for edge definition, quantum noise level, and object conspicuity. Analysis of variance and Tukey honest significant difference post hoc tests were used to analyze differences between reconstruction algorithms. Results Images from 19 patients (mean age, 11 years ± 5 [standard deviation]; 10 female patients) were evaluated. Compared with FBP, SBIR, and MBIR, DLR demonstrated improved object detectability by 51% (16.5 of 10.9), 18% (16.5 of 13.9), and 11% (16.5 of 14.8), respectively. DLR reduced image noise without noise texture effects seen with MBIR. Radiologist ratings were 7 ± 1 (DLR), 6.2 ± 1 (MBIR), 6.2 ± 1 (SBIR), and 4.6 ± 1 (FBP); two-way analysis of variance showed a difference on the basis of reconstruction type (P < .001). Radiologists consistently preferred DLR images (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.93). DLR demonstrated 52% (1 of 2.1) greater dose reduction than SBIR. Conclusion The DLR algorithm improved image quality and dose reduction without sacrificing noise texture and spatial resolution.</details> |  ❌

Incomplete projection data will lead to severe artifacts and distortions in reconstruction images. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel reconstruction framework termed Deep Iterative Optimization-based Residual-learning (DIOR) for limited-angle CT. Instead of directly deploying the regularization term on image space, the DIOR combines iterative optimization and deep learning based on the residual domain, significantly improving the convergence property and generalization ability. Specifically, the asymmetric convolutional modules are adopted to strengthen the feature extraction capacity in smooth regions for deep priors. Besides, in our DIOR method, the information contained in low-frequency and high-frequency components is also evaluated by perceptual loss to improve the performance in tissue preservation. Both simulated and clinical datasets are performed to validate the performance of DIOR. Compared with existing competitive algorithms, quantitative and qualitative results show that the proposed method brings a promising improvement in artifact removal, detail restoration and edge preservation.</details> |   ❌

Recently, deep learning-based image post-processing methods along with their dual-domain counterparts have shown promising results. However, existing methods usually produce over-smoothed images with loss of details due to i) the difficulty in accurately modeling the artifact patterns in the image domain, and ii) the equal treatment of each pixel in the loss function. To address these issues, we concentrate on the image post-processing and propose a simple yet effective FREquency-band-awarE and SElf-guidED network, termed FreeSeed, which can effectively remove artifacts and recover missing details from the contaminated sparse-view CT images. Specifically, we first propose a frequency-band-aware artifact modeling network (FreeNet), which learns artifact-related frequency-band attention in the Fourier domain for better modeling the globally distributed streak artifact on the sparse-view CT images. We then introduce a self-guided artifact refinement network (SeedNet), which leverages the predicted artifact to assist FreeNet in continuing to refine the severely corrupted details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of FreeSeed and its dual-domain counterpart over the state-of-the-art sparse-view CT reconstruction methods.

They have also been shown to be effective inverse problem solvers, acting as the prior of the distribution, while the information of the forward model can be granted at the sampling stage. Nonetheless, as the generative process remains in the same high dimensional (i.e. identical to data dimension) space, the models have not been extended to 3D inverse problems due to the extremely high memory and computational cost. In this paper, we combine the ideas from the conventional model-based iterative reconstruction with the modern diffusion models, which leads to a highly effective method for solving 3D medical image reconstruction tasks such as sparse-view tomography, limited angle tomography, compressed sensing MRI from pre-trained 2D diffusion models. In essence, we propose to augment the 2D diffusion prior with a model-based prior in the remaining direction at test time, such that one can achieve coherent reconstructions across all dimensions. Our method can be run in a single commodity GPU, and establishes the new state-of-the-art, showing that the proposed method can perform reconstructions of high fidelity and accuracy even in the most extreme cases (e.g. 2-view 3D tomography). We further reveal that the generalization capacity of the proposed method is surprisingly high, and can be used to reconstruct volumes that are entirely different from the training dataset.

Using fewer projection views to reconstruct CT also known as sparse-view reconstruction can reduce ionizing radiation and further benefit interventional radiology. Compared with sparse-view reconstruction for traditional parallel/fan-beam CT CBCT reconstruction is more challenging due to the increased dimensionality caused by the measurement process based on cone-shaped X-ray beams. As a 2D-to-3D reconstruction problem although implicit neural representations have been introduced to enable efficient training only local features are considered and different views are processed equally in previous works resulting in spatial inconsistency and poor performance on complicated anatomies. To this end we propose C^2RV by leveraging explicit multi-scale volumetric representations to enable cross-regional learning in the 3D space. Additionally the scale-view cross-attention module is introduced to adaptively aggregate multi-scale and multi-view features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our C^2RV achieves consistent and significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on datasets with diverse anatomy.

The low definition of knee magnetic resonance image texture seriously affects the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis. This paper presents a super-resolution reconstruction method to address this problem. Methods In this paper, we propose an efficient medical image super-resolution (EMISR) method, in which we mainly adopted three hidden layers of super-resolution convolution neural network (SRCNN) and a sub-pixel convolution layer of efficient sub-pixel convolution neural network (ESPCN). The addition of the efficient sub-pixel convolutional layer in the hidden layer and the small network replacement consisting of concatenated convolutions to address low-resolution images but not high-resolution images are important. The EMISR method also uses cascaded small convolution kernels to improve reconstruction speed and deepen the convolution neural network to improve reconstruction quality.

Beyond improving patient experience and reducing operational costs, faster scans are essential for time-sensitive imaging, such as fetal, cardiac, or functional MRI, where temporal resolution is important and target movement is unavoidable, yet must be reduced. Current MRI acquisition methods speed up scan time at the expense of lower spatial resolution and costlier hardware. We introduce a practical, software-only framework, based on deep learning, for accelerating MRI acquisition, while maintaining anatomically meaningful imaging. This is accomplished by MRI subsampling followed by estimating the missing k-space samples via generative adversarial neural networks. A generator-discriminator interplay enables the introduction of an adversarial cost in addition to fidelity and image-quality losses used for optimizing the reconstruction. Promising reconstruction results are obtained from feasible sampling patterns of up to a fivefold acceleration of diverse brain MRIs, from a large publicly available dataset of healthy adult scans as well as multimodal acquisitions of multiple sclerosis patients and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) sequences of stroke and tumor patients. Clinical usability of the reconstructed MRI scans is assessed by performing either lesion or healthy tissue segmentation and comparing the results to those obtained by using the original, fully sampled images. Reconstruction quality and usability of the DCE-MRI sequences is demonstrated by calculating the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. The proposed MRI reconstruction approach is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods for all datasets tested in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the structural similarity index (SSIM), as well as either the mean squared error (MSE) with respect to the PK parameters, calculated for the fully sampled DCE-MRI sequences, or the segmentation compatibility, measured in terms of Dice scores and Hausdorff distance.

More generic a prior information could be acquired via deep learning and utilized for image reconstruction. In this study, we developed a volumetric hierarchical deep residual convolutional neural network, referred to as T-Net, to provide a data-driven end-to-end mapping from sparsely sampled MR images to fully sampled MR images, where cartilage MR images were acquired using an Ultra-short TE sequence and retrospectively undersampled using pseudo-random Cartesian and radial acquisition schemes. The network had a hierarchical architecture that promoted the sparsity of feature maps and increased the receptive field, which were valuable for signal synthesis and artifact suppression. Relatively dense local connections and global shortcuts were established to facilitate residual learning and compensate for details lost in hierarchical processing. Additionally, volumetric processing was adopted to fully exploit spatial continuity in three-dimensional space. Data consistency was further enforced. The network was trained with 336 three-dimensional images (each consisting of 32 slices) and tested by 24 images.

Towards this, unsupervised methods reconstruct a 2D/3D single medical image to detect outliers either in the learned feature space or from high reconstruction loss. However, without considering continuity between multiple adjacent slices, they cannot directly discriminate diseases composed of the accumulation of subtle anatomical anomalies, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Moreover, no study has shown how unsupervised anomaly detection is associated with either disease stages, various (i.e., more than two types of) diseases, or multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Results We propose unsupervised medical anomaly detection generative adversarial network (MADGAN), a novel two-step method using GAN-based multiple adjacent brain MRI slice reconstruction to detect brain anomalies at different stages on multi-sequence structural MRI: (Reconstruction) Wasserstein loss with Gradient Penalty + 100  loss—trained on 3 healthy brain axial MRI slices to reconstruct the next 3 ones—reconstructs unseen healthy/abnormal scans; (Diagnosis) Average  loss per scan discriminates them, comparing the ground truth/reconstructed slices. For training, we use two different datasets composed of 1133 healthy T1-weighted (T1) and 135 healthy contrast-enhanced T1 (T1c) brain MRI scans for detecting AD and brain metastases/various diseases, respectively. Our self-attention MADGAN can detect AD on T1 scans at a very early stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with area under the curve (AUC) 0.727, and AD at a late stage with AUC 0.894, while detecting brain metastases on T1c scans with AUC 0.921. Conclusions Similar to physicians’ way of performing a diagnosis, using massive healthy training data, our first multiple MRI slice reconstruction approach, MADGAN, can reliably predict the next 3 slices from the previous 3 ones only for unseen healthy images. As the first unsupervised various disease diagnosis, MADGAN can reliably detect the accumulation of subtle anatomical anomalies and hyper-intense enhancing lesions, such as (especially late-stage) AD and brain metastases on multi-sequence MRI scans.</details> |  ❌

However, it is more challenging to reconstruct 3D MRI images. Current methods are mainly based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) with small kernels, which are difficult to scale up to have sufficient fitting power for 3D MRI reconstruction due to the large image size and GPU memory constraint. Furthermore, MRI reconstruction is a deconvolution problem, which demands long-distance information that is difficult to capture by CNNs with small convolution kernels. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) can model such long-distance information, but it requires a fixed input size. In this paper, we proposed Recon3DMLP, a hybrid of CNN modules with small kernels for low-frequency reconstruction and adaptive MLP (dMLP) modules with large kernels to boost the high-frequency reconstruction, for 3D MRI reconstruction. We further utilized the circular shift operation based on MRI physics such that dMLP accepts arbitrary image size and can extract global information from the entire FOV. We also propose a GPU memory efficient data fidelity module that can reduce >50% memory. We compared Recon3DMLP with other CNN-based models on a high-resolution (HR) 3D MRI dataset.

We proposed a more efficient network design for positron emission tomography called DirectPET, which is capable of reconstructing multislice image volumes (i.e., 16  ×  400  ×  400) from sinograms. Approach: Large-scale direct neural network reconstruction is accomplished by addressing the associated memory space challenge through the introduction of a specially designed Radon inversion layer. Using patient data, we compare the proposed method to the benchmark ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm using signal-to-noise ratio, bias, mean absolute error, and structural similarity measures. In addition, line profiles and full-width half-maximum measurements are provided for a sample of lesions. Results: DirectPET is shown capable of producing images that are quantitatively and qualitatively similar to the OSEM target images in a fraction of the time. We also report on an experiment where DirectPET is trained to map low-count raw data to normal count target images, demonstrating the method’s ability to maintain image quality under a low-dose scenario. Conclusion: The ability of DirectPET to quickly reconstruct high-quality, multislice image volumes suggests potential clinical viability of the method. However, design parameters and performance boundaries need to be fully established before adoption can be considered.[/details] |  ❌

Methods List-mode data from 277 [18F]-FDG PET/CT scans, from six centres using GE Discovery PET/CT scanners, were split into ¾-, ½- and ¼-duration scans. Full-duration datasets were reconstructed using the convergent block sequential regularised expectation maximisation (BSREM) algorithm. Short-duration datasets were reconstructed with the faster OSEM algorithm. The 277 examinations were divided into training (n = 237), validation (n = 15) and testing (n = 25) sets. Three deep learning enhancement (DLE) models were trained to map full and partial-duration OSEM images into their target full-duration BSREM images. In addition to standardised uptake value (SUV) evaluations in lesions, liver and lungs, two experienced radiologists scored the quality of testing set images and BSREM in a blinded clinical reading (175 series).ResultsOSEM reconstructions demonstrated up to 22% difference in lesion SUVmax, for different scan durations, compared to full-duration BSREM. Application of the DLE models reduced this difference significantly for full-, ¾- and ½-duration scans, while simultaneously reducing the noise in the liver. The clinical reading showed that the standard DLE model with full- or ¾-duration scans provided an image quality substantially comparable to full-duration scans with BSREM reconstruction, yet in a shorter reconstruction time. Conclusion Deep learning–based image enhancement models may allow a reduction in scan time (or injected activity) by up to 50%, and can decrease reconstruction time to a third, while maintaining image quality.</details> |  ❌

However, therapeutic radionuclides often provide poor images, which translate to inaccurate treatment planning and inadequate monitoring images. Multimodality information can be exploited in the reconstruction to enhance image quality. Triple modality PET/SPECT/CT scanners are particularly useful in this context due to the easier registration process between images. In this study, we propose to include PET, SPECT and CT information in the reconstruction of PET data. The method is applied to Yttrium-90 (90Y) data.MethodsData from a NEMA phantom filled with 90Y were used for validation. PET, SPECT and CT data from 10 patients treated with Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) were used. Different combinations of prior images using the Hybrid kernelized expectation maximization were investigated in terms of VOI activity and noise suppression.ResultsOur results show that triple modality PET reconstruction provides significantly higher uptake when compared to the method used as standard in the hospital and OSEM. In particular, using CT-guided SPECT images, as guiding information in the PET reconstruction significantly increases uptake quantification on tumoral lesions.ConclusionThis work proposes the first triple modality reconstruction method and demonstrates up to 69% lesion uptake increase over standard methods with SIRT 90Y patient data.

Deep image prior (DIP) has recently attracted attention owing to its unsupervised positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction method, which does not require any prior training dataset. In this paper, we present the first attempt to implement an end-to-end DIP-based fully 3D PET image reconstruction method that incorporates a forward-projection model into a loss function. Approach. A practical implementation of a fully 3D PET image reconstruction could not be performed at present because of a graphics processing unit memory limitation. Consequently, we modify the DIP optimization to a block iteration and sequential learning of an ordered sequence of block sinograms. Furthermore, the relative difference penalty (RDP) term is added to the loss function to enhance the quantitative accuracy of the PET image. Main results. We evaluated our proposed method using Monte Carlo simulation with [18F]FDG PET data of a human brain and a preclinical study on monkey-brain [18F]FDG PET data. The proposed method was compared with the maximum-likelihood expectation maximization (EM), maximum a posteriori EM with RDP, and hybrid DIP-based PET reconstruction methods. The simulation results showed that, compared with other algorithms, the proposed method improved the PET image quality by reducing statistical noise and better preserved the contrast of brain structures and inserted tumors. In the preclinical experiment, finer structures and better contrast recovery were obtained with the proposed method. Significance. The results indicated that the proposed method could produce high-quality images without a prior training dataset.

Although various image processing techniques have been presented, they may degrade the contrast of denoised images. The proposed idea in this study is to use a deep neural network as the denoising procedure during the iterative reconstruction process rather than the post-reconstruction phase. This method could decrease the background coefficient of variation (COV_bkg) of the final reconstructed image, which represents the amount of random noise, while improving the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR).MethodsIn this study, a generative adversarial network is used, where its generator is trained by a two-phase approach. In the first phase, the network is trained by a confined image region around the heart in transverse view. The second phase improves the network’s generalization by tuning the network weights with the full image size as the input. The network was trained and tested by a dataset of 247 patients who underwent two immediate serially high- and low-noise SPECT-MPI.ResultsQuantitative results show that compared to post-reconstruction low pass filtering and post-reconstruction deep denoising methods, our proposed method can decline the COV_bkg of the images by up to 10.28% and 12.52% and enhance the CNR by up to 54.54% and 45.82%, respectively.ConclusionThe iterative deep denoising method outperforms 2D low-pass Gaussian filtering with an 8.4-mm FWHM and post-reconstruction deep denoising approaches.</details> |   [🔗](https://github.com/FYousefzadeh/in-house-simple-OSEM2D-code.git)

Recently, 3D Gaussian has been applied to model complex natural scenes, demonstrating fast convergence and better rendering of novel views compared to implicit neural representations (INRs). Taking inspiration from the successful application of 3D Gaussians in natural scene modeling and novel view synthesis, we investigate their potential for sparse-view CT reconstruction. We leverage prior information from the filtered-backprojection reconstructed image to initialize the Gaussians; and update their parameters via comparing difference in the projection space. Performance is further enhanced by adaptive density control. Compared to INRs, 3D Gaussians benefit more from prior information to explicitly bypass learning in void spaces and allocate the capacity efficiently, accelerating convergence. 3D Gaussians also efficiently learn high-frequency details. Trained in a self-supervised manner, 3D Gaussians avoid the need for large-scale paired data.

Previous voxel-based generation methods represent the CT as discrete voxels, resulting in high memory requirements and limited spatial resolution due to the use of 3D decoders. In this paper, we formulate the CT volume as a continuous intensity field and develop a novel DIF-Net to perform high-quality CBCT reconstruction from extremely sparse (≤10) projection views at an ultrafast speed. The intensity field of a CT can be regarded as a continuous function of 3D spatial points. Therefore, the reconstruction can be reformulated as regressing the intensity value of an arbitrary 3D point from given sparse projections. Specifically, for a point, DIF-Net extracts its view-specific features from different 2D projection views. These features are subsequently aggregated by a fusion module for intensity estimation. Notably, thousands of points can be processed in parallel to improve efficiency during training and testing. In practice, we collect a knee CBCT dataset to train and evaluate DIF-Net. Extensive experiments show that our approach can reconstruct CBCT with high image quality and high spatial resolution from extremely sparse views within 1.6 s, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Due to limited counts received, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and resolution of parametric images produced by direct reconstruction frameworks are still limited. Recently supervised deep learning methods have been successfully applied to medical imaging denoising/reconstruction when large number of high-quality training labels are available. For static PET imaging, high-quality training labels can be acquired by extending the scanning time. However, this is not feasible for dynamic PET imaging, where the scanning time is already long enough. In this work, we proposed an unsupervised deep learning framework for direct parametric reconstruction from dynamic PET, which was tested on the Patlak model and the relative equilibrium Logan model. The training objective function was based on the PET statistical model. The patient’s anatomical prior image, which is readily available from PET/CT or PET/MR scans, was supplied as the network input to provide a manifold constraint, and also utilized to construct a kernel layer to perform non-local feature denoising. The linear kinetic model was embedded in the network structure as a 1×1×1 convolution layer.

Traditional methods typically require hundreds of 2D X-ray projections to reconstruct a high-quality 3D CBCT image, leading to considerable radiation exposure. This has led to a growing interest in sparse-view CBCT reconstruction to reduce radiation doses. While recent advances, including deep learning and neural rendering algorithms, have made strides in this area, these methods either produce unsatisfactory results or suffer from time inefficiency of individual optimization. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometry-aware encoder-decoder framework to solve this problem. Our framework starts by encoding multi-view 2D features from various 2D X-ray projections with a 2D CNN encoder. Leveraging the geometry of CBCT scanning, it then back-projects the multi-view 2D features into the 3D space to formulate a comprehensive volumetric feature map, followed by a 3D CNN decoder to recover 3D CBCT image. Importantly, our approach respects the geometric relationship between 3D CBCT image and its 2D X-ray projections during feature back projection stage, and enjoys the prior knowledge learned from the data population. This ensures its adaptability in dealing with extremely sparse view inputs without individual training, such as scenarios with only 5 or 10 X-ray projections.

Our proposed method leverages a ray-tracing-based neural rendering for novel view US synthesis. Recent publications demonstrated that INR models could encode a representation of a three-dimensional scene from a set of two-dimensional US frames. However, these models fail to consider the view-dependent changes in appearance and geometry intrinsic to US imaging. In our work, we discuss direction-dependent changes in the scene and show that a physics-inspired rendering improves the fidelity of US image synthesis. In particular, we demonstrate experimentally that our proposed method generates geometrically accurate B-mode images for regions with ambiguous representation owing to view-dependent differences of the US images. We conduct our experiments using simulated B-mode US sweeps of the liver and acquired US sweeps of a spine phantom tracked with a robotic arm. The experiments corroborate that our method generates US frames that enable consistent volume compounding from previously unseen views.

However, traditional 3D ultrasound imaging methods have limitations such as fixed resolution, low storage efficiency, and insufficient contextual connectivity, leading to poor performance in handling complex artifacts and reflection characteristics. Recently, techniques based on NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) have made significant progress in view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, but there remains a research gap in high-quality ultrasound imaging. To address these issues, we propose a new model, UlRe-NeRF, which combines implicit neural networks and explicit ultrasound volume rendering into an ultrasound neural rendering architecture. This model incorporates reflection direction parameterization and harmonic encoding, using a directional MLP module to generate view-dependent high-frequency reflection intensity estimates, and a spatial MLP module to produce the medium's physical property parameters. These parameters are used in the volume rendering process to accurately reproduce the propagation and reflection behavior of ultrasound waves in the medium. Experimental results demonstrate that the UlRe-NeRF model significantly enhances the realism and accuracy of high-fidelity ultrasound image reconstruction, especially in handling complex medium structures. </details>  |  ❌

The artifacts produced by current approaches differ from NeRF floaters in general scenes because of the unique nature of ultrasound capture. Furthermore, existing models fail to produce reasonable 3D reconstructions when ultrasound data is captured or obtained casually in uncontrolled environments, which is common in clinical settings. Consequently, existing reconstruction and NVS methods struggle to handle ultrasound motion, fail to capture intricate details, and cannot model transparent and reflective surfaces. In this work, we introduced NeRF-US, which incorporates 3D-geometry guidance for border probability and scattering density into NeRF training, while also utilizing ultrasound-specific rendering over traditional volume rendering. These 3D priors are learned through a diffusion model. Through experiments conducted on our new "Ultrasound in the Wild" dataset, we observed accurate, clinically plausible, artifact-free reconstructions. </details>  |  [🔗](rishitdagli.com/nerf-us/)

Surface reconstruction of US volume is vital to acquire the accurate anatomical structures needed for modeling, registration, and visualization. However, traditional methods cannot produce a high-quality surface due to image noise. Despite improvements in smoothness, continuity, and resolution from deep learning approaches, research on surface reconstruction in freehand 3D US is still limited. This study introduces FUNSR, a self-supervised neural implicit surface reconstruction method to learn signed distance functions (SDFs) from US volumes. In particular, FUNSR iteratively learns the SDFs by moving the 3D queries sampled around volumetric point clouds to approximate the surface, guided by two novel geometric constraints: sign consistency constraint and on-surface constraint with adversarial learning. Our approach has been thoroughly evaluated across four datasets to demonstrate its adaptability to various anatomical structures, including a hip phantom dataset, two vascular datasets and one publicly available prostate dataset. We also show that smooth and continuous representations greatly enhance the visual appearance of US data. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of our method to improve segmentation performance, and its robustness to noise distribution and motion perturbation. </details>  |  [🔗](https://github.com/chenhbo/FUNSR)

In contrast to the conventional way that represents a 3D volume as a discrete voxel grid, we do so by parameterizing it as the zero level-set of a continuous function, i.e. implicitly representing the 3D volume as a mapping from the spatial coordinates to the corresponding intensity values. Our proposed model, termed as ImplicitVol, takes a set of 2D scans and their estimated locations in 3D as input, jointly refining the estimated 3D locations and learning a full reconstruction of the 3D volume. When testing on real 2D ultrasound images, novel cross-sectional views that are sampled from ImplicitVol show significantly better visual quality than those sampled from existing reconstruction approaches, outperforming them by over 30% (NCC and SSIM), between the output and ground-truth on the 3D volume testing data.

Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in medical research and clinical diagnosis. However, acquiring CT data requires patients to be exposed to considerable ionizing radiance, leading to physical harm. Recent studies have considered using neural radiance field (NERF) techniques to infer the full-view CT projections from single-view x-ray projection, thus aiding physician judgment and reducing Radiance hazards. This paper enhances this technique in two directions: (1) accurate generalization capabilities for control models. (2) Consider different ranges of viewpoints. Approach. Building upon generative radiance fields (GRAF), we propose a method called ACnerf to enhance the generalization of the NERF through alignment and pose correction. ACnerf aligns with a reference single x-ray by utilizing a combination of positional encoding with Gaussian random noise (latent code) obtained from GRAF training. This approach avoids compromising the 3D structure caused by altering the generator. During inference, a pose judgment network is employed to correct the pose and optimize the rendered viewpoint. Additionally, when generating a narrow range of views, ACnerf employs frequency-domain regularization to fine-tune the generator and achieve precise projections. Main results. The proposed ACnerf method surpasses the state-of-the-art NERF technique in terms of rendering quality for knee and chest data with varying contrasts. It achieved an average improvement of 2.496 dB in PSNR and 41% in LPIPS for 0°–360° projections. Additionally, for −15° to 15° projections, ACnerf achieved an average improvement of 0.691 dB in PSNR and 25.8% in LPIPS. Significance. With adjustments in alignment, inference, and rendering range, our experiments and evaluations on knee and chest data of different contrasts show that ACnerf effectively reduces artifacts and aberrations in the new view. ACnerf's ability to recover more accurate 3D structures from single x-rays has excellent potential for reducing damage from ionising radiation in clinical diagnostics.</details>  | ❌

However, these reconstructions often require many scan acquisitions, demanding a long session to use the machine and requiring the patient to remain still, with consequent possible motion artifacts. The development of neural radiance fields (NeRF) technology has shown promising results in generating highly accurate 3D reconstructions of MRI images with less user input. Our approach is based on neural radiance fields to reconstruct 3D projections from 2D slices of MRI scans. We do this by using 3D convolutional neural networks to address challenges posed by variable slice thickness; incorporating multiple MRI modalities to ensure robustness and extracting the shape and volumetric depth of both surface and internal anatomical structures with slice interpolation.

However, the requirement of excessive high-quality ground-truth data hinders their applications due to the generalization problem. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful DL-based tool for solving the inverse problem by characterizing the attributes of a signal as a continuous function of corresponding coordinates in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we proposed an INR-based method to improve dynamic MRI reconstruction from highly undersampled k-space data, which only takes spatiotemporal coordinates as inputs and does not require any training on external datasets or transfer-learning from prior images. Specifically, the proposed method encodes the dynamic MRI images into neural networks as an implicit function, and the weights of the network are learned from sparsely-acquired (k, t)-space data itself only. Benefiting from the strong implicit continuity regularization of INR together with explicit regularization for low-rankness and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods at various acceleration factors. E.g., experiments on retrospective cardiac cine datasets show an improvement of 0.6–2.0 dB in PSNR for high accelerations (up to 40.8×).

In this work, we present NeSVoR, a resolution-agnostic slice-to-volume reconstruction method, which models the underlying volume as a continuous function of spatial coordinates with implicit neural representation. To improve robustness to subject motion and other image artifacts, we adopt a continuous and comprehensive slice acquisition model that takes into account rigid inter-slice motion, point spread function, and bias fields. NeSVoR also estimates pixel-wise and slice-wise variances of image noise and enables removal of outliers during reconstruction and visualization of uncertainty.
